    <p><i>Minsooni is the <strong>cutest among <a href="/Sooni.html">Soonies</a></strong></i></p>
    <p>Minsooni is now studying Programming (especally Python) after liberation from JYP
        <br>You want to ask if JYP period was bad?
        <br>Well.. I sometimes overworked there but it was not bad! (I would like to say it was better company than others perhaps..) 
        I experienced lots of interesting things. Also I achieved lots of things. 
        just I was thinking I want to find more time for myself! for my future!</p>
